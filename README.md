# 🎬 Netflix UI Clone – Learning Project (HTML + CSS)

This is a Netflix homepage UI clone that I finally built after MONTHS of being confused about HTML and CSS.
I kept restarting, watching tutorials, trying things, deleting everything, and starting again (literally a million times).
But this is the first time I actually completed something — and it genuinely boosted my confidence.

I used the old Netflix layout as a reference from CodeWithHarry’s video,
but I wrote all the code myself, section by section, understanding how EVERYTHING works instead of copy-pasting.

This project is *not responsive yet*, but the full desktop UI is done and deployed.

## 📌 Why I Built This

I used to be stuck in the “learn HTML/CSS but never build anything” loop.
Every time I tried making a project, I felt lost:

- Where to start?
- What tags to use?
- How to structure sections?
- How to position things?
- How to apply the concepts I learned?

I knew I had to break that cycle.

So I picked Netflix — a familiar UI with clear sections — and decided to build it with real understanding this time.

This project became my turning point.

## 🛠️ Tech Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3** (Flexbox, overlays, positioning, z-index)
- **Vercel** for deployment
- Assets inspired by CodeWithHarry’s old Netflix project, but built manually in my own structure and style.

## 🧠 What I Learned Through This

Honestly, a LOT:

- How to break a website into clean sections
- How to think like a frontend dev instead of “copying tutorials”
- How `position: relative` and `absolute` actually work
- How overlays and background images stack
- How flexbox controls alignment
- Understanding z-index and layering
- How to structure a real project folder
- How deployment works through GitHub + Vercel

Most importantly:
**I learned that I *CAN* build things from scratch.**

This project finally gave me the confidence I was lacking.

## 📱 Responsiveness (Coming Soon)

Right now the site is desktop-only.
I will be adding:

- media queries
- mobile-friendly stacking
- resized images/videos
- optimized spacing

## 🚀 Deployment

Deployed through **Vercel**, connected directly to my GitHub repo.
Every push updates the live site automatically.
